The Image Processing App is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to upload, process, and apply various image transformations using OpenCV. With a simple and interactive interface, users can apply filters like grayscale, blur, and edge detection in real-time. The app provides a seamless experience for modifying images and downloading the processed results. Built using Python, OpenCV, and Streamlit, this project is ideal for beginners exploring computer vision. To get started, simply install the required dependencies, run the app, and begin experimenting with different image processing techniques.
